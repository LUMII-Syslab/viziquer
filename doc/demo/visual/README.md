# Visual Presentation and Summarization of Linked Data Schemas

We provide supporting material for a submission to KGSWC'24 conference.

## ViziQuer Playground

The ViziQuer Playground is available at https://viziquer.app.

After opening https://viziquer.app, register a user (anonymous e-mail formatted usernames are accepted), then proceed to create a new project.

To explore the schemas considered in the project, choose `Initialize by LOD schema examples` (may need to wait for 2-3 minutes, while all data schema visualizations are lodaed).

There is an option to upload the project file from the `visual_project` folder into an existing project in ViziQuer environment (cloud icon with upwards arrow in the project diagram's view toolbar).

To re-generate a data schema from scratch (e.g., using different parameters), 
choose the desired data schema first in the project's settings dialogue (gear icon in the diagram's view toolbar). Then use the `Data Schema` button and follow the dialogue there. 
Choose the intial class and property lists and switch to the tab `Class Merging parameters` 
to choose the options for configuring the class merging strength and other visualization parameters.

## Visual Query Options

Besides the schema visualization, there is an option of ![visual query creation](https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/viziquer/wiki/Creating-Visual-Queries) in the tool.


## Local ViziQuer Tool Suite installation (advanced)

Local ViziQuer tool installation is (currently) necessary for working with the schemas that are not pre-loaded in the environment. 
Consider [ViziQuer wiki entry](https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/viziquer/wiki/Local-Installation) for details.
