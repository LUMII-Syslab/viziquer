# Visual Data and Schema Queries over Knowledge Graphs

We provide supporting material for a poster paper submission at EKAW'2024 conference.

The basic information on getting started with the ViziQuer tool is available in
[ViziQuer wiki](https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/viziquer/wiki).

The [ViziQuer tool main page](https://viziquer.lumii.lv) can be consulted for further information.

The environments referenced in the paper are available live 
on [ViziQuer Playground](https://viziquer.app). 
Registration with any e-mail formatted string is accepted.

Choose the `nobel_prizes_simple` data schema for the data query environment 
and `nobel_prizes_schema` for the schema environment. 
Note: switch between schemas in the Parameters dialogue (gear icon in the Diagrams view).

Upload the project `np_meta_schemas_project.json` into the visual tool environment 
to access live versions of the schema and query diagrams presented in the paper.
Note: create a project, then enter the Diagrams view and use the upload icon 
(a cloud image, with an up arrow) for uploading.
